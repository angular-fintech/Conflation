# Conflation

**Conflation** is a multi-language toolkit for financial market data conflation, leveraging Reactive Extensions (Rx) to manage and merge high-frequency data streams efficiently.

## Overview

In financial markets, data from various sources often needs to be merged or "conflated" to provide a coherent view. This repository offers implementations of conflation mechanisms across multiple programming languages, facilitating consistent data processing in diverse system architectures.

## Features

* **Multi-language Support**: Implementations available in C++, .NET, Java, and JavaScript.
* **Reactive Programming**: Utilizes Rx paradigms for asynchronous data stream handling.
* **Modular Design**: Each language-specific implementation is encapsulated for ease of integration.
* **Open Source**: Released under the MIT License for broad usability.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the necessary development environments set up for the language(s) you intend to use:

* **C++**: C++17 compatible compiler
* **.NET**: .NET 6.0 SDK or later
* **Java**: JDK 11 or later
* **JavaScript**: Node.js 14 or later([Built In][1])

### Building and Running

Navigate to the directory of the desired implementation and follow the standard build and run procedures for that language. For example:

**.NET Example**:

```bash
cd ConflationDotNet
dotnet build
dotnet run
```



**Java Example**:

```bash
cd ConflationJava
./gradlew build
./gradlew run
```



**JavaScript Example**:

```bash
cd ConflationJavaScript
npm install
npm start
```



**C++ Example**:

```bash
cd ConflationCPP
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./conflation_app
```



\*Note: Replace `conflation_app` with the actual executable name generated.\*([GitHub][2])
